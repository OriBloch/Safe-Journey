#positioning assumptions
#1 car accident 400m from route point is not dangerous
#2 car accident 200m from route point is dangerous
#3 car accident less than 200m is very dangerous

#time assumptions
#4 car accident happened more than 2 years ago is not dangerous
#5 car accident happened 1 - 2 years ago is dangerous
#6 car accident happened less than 1 year ago is very dangerous

#dangerous crosssection
#7 if in 200m radius less than 5 accidents happened this year it is not dangerous
#8 if in 200m radius 5-10 accidents happened this year it is dangerous
#9 if in 200m radius 10+ accidents happened this year it is very dangerous
